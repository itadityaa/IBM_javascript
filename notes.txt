In JavaScript, variables are used to store and manage data. Variables act as containers for various types of information or values. You can think of a variable as a named storage location that holds data, and you can use this data in your JavaScript code.

To create a variable in JavaScript, you also need to declare it using one of three keywords, var, let, or const. The declaration tells JavaScript that you want to reserve a spot in memory to store data.

Var was the original way to declare variables in JavaScript, and it has function level scope. This means that a variable declared with var is available throughout the entire function in which it is declared.

Let was introduced in ES6 and provides block level scoping. This means, that a variable declared with let is only available within the block enclosed by curly braces in which it is defined. This scope is more predictable and less error prone.

Const is also introduced in ES6 and is used to declare variables with constant values. Once you assign a value to a const variable, you cannot reassign it a different value. It also has block level scoping. Const variables are often used for values that should not change, such as mathematical constants or references to immutable objects.

Variable names must start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign, and can contain letters, numbers, underscores, and dollar signs. Variable names are case sensitive.

Variables declared with let can be reassigned, but not redeclared within the same block. 
Valid: 
{
  let a=9;
  a=12;
}

Invalid:
{
  let a=0;
  let a=12; // will give error
}

Variables declared with let can be reassigned, but not redeclared within the same block. 

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that you don't need to explicitly specify the data type of a variable when you declare it. The data type is determined dynamically at runtime based on the value you assign to the variable.

JavaScript has several built-in data types, which can be categorized into the following major categories. Primitive data types, composite data types.

Primitive:
Strings represents text. A string is enclosed in single or double quotes. Number represents both integers and floating-point numbers. Boolean represents true or false values. Undefined represents a variable that has been declared, but hasn't been assigned a value. Null represents an empty value or absence of any object value.

Composite: 
Composite data types are those that can hold and manage multiple values as a single unit. These data types are used to organize and manipulate collections of data.

Array and object are two composite data types. An array in JavaScript is a list like data structure for storing multiple value. While an object is a collection of key value pairs used for structured data storage. JavaScript's dynamic typing allows variables to change data types during execution.

Operators in JavaScript are special symbols or keywords used to perform operations on variables and values. JavaScript supports a variety of operators, including: arithmetic operators, comparison operators, logical operators, assignment operators, unary operators, and typeof operators.

Arithmetic operators are used for basic mathematical calculations. Common arithmetic operators include: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. 

Comparison operators are used to compare two values or variables and return a Boolean true or false result. Common comparison operators include: equality, inequality, strict equality, strict inequality, less than, greater than, less than or equal to, and greater than or equal to.

# Example
let a = 5;
let b = 6;

let isEqual = a == b; // equality
let isNotEqual = a != b; // inequality
let isStrictEqual = a === b; // strict equality
let isStrictNotEqual = a !==b; // strict inequality
let isGreaterThan = a > b; // greater than
let isLessThan = a < b; // less than
let isGreaterOrEqual = a >= b; // greater than or equality
let isLessOrEqual = a <= b; // less than or equality

Logical operators are used to combine or manipulate Boolean values. Common logical operators include logical AND, logical OR, and logical NOT.
&& - AND
|| - OR
! - NOT

Unary operators operate on a single value or variable. Common unary operators include increment and decrement.
let a = 5;
a++;
a--;

The typeof operator is a built-in operator in JavaScript that allows you to determine the data type of a variable or an expression. It returns a string representing the type of operand.

The possible return values for typeof are: "Undefined" if the variable is declared but not defined, "Object" for objects, arrays, and null, "Boolean" for Boolean values, "Number" for numbers, and "String" for strings.

let myVar = 42;
let myVarType = typeof myVar;

An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators that can be evaluated to produce a single value.

Control flow refers to the order in which statements are executed in a JavaScript program. While conditional statements, often referred to as decision making statements, are used to manage this flow based on specified conditions. Some of the conditional statements in JavaScript are if statement, else if statement, else statement, nested if else statement, switch statement, and ternary operator.

let age = 25;
let name = "John";

if (age > 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult");
} else if (age < 18) {
  console.log("You are a minor");
} else {
  console.log("You are a teenager");
}

const temperture = 20;
const isRaining = true;

if (temperature > 18) {
  if (isRaining) {
    console.log("It's warm and raining");
  } else {
    console.log("It's warm and not raining");
  }
} else {
  console.log("It's cold");
}

The switch statement allows you to compare a value against multiple possible case values and execute code based on the first matching case.

let day = "Friday";
switch (day) {
  case "Monday":
    console.log("Today is Monday");
    break;
  case "Tuesday":
    console.log("Today is Tuesday");
    break;
  case "Wednesday":
    console.log("Today is Wednesday");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Have a nice day");
}

The ternary operator is a concise way to write conditional statements such as if else condition.
let age = 25;
let canVote = age >= 18 ? 'yes' : 'no';

A for loop is a control structure in JavaScript that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly for a specified number of times, or until a particular condition is met. It consists of three parts, initialization, condition, and update. Initialization, this part is where you initialize a loop control variable, typically with an initial value. Condition, this is a Boolean expression that is evaluated before each iteration. If the condition is true, the loop continues, otherwise it terminates. Update, this part is responsible for changing the loop control variable in each iteration, often incrementing or decrementing its value.

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
} - prints 0 to 9

A while loop is a control structure in JavaScript that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly. As long as the specified condition is true, it continually evaluates the condition before each iteration.

let counter = 5;
while (counter > 0) {
  console.log(counter);
  counter--;
}

A do while loop in JavaScript is a control structure that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true. Unlike the for or while loops, a do while loop guarantees that the code block will execute at least once, even if the condition is initially false. The structure of a do while loop is as follows. The code block is executed first, then the condition is checked. If the condition is true, the loop continues and the code block is executed again. If the condition is false, the loop terminates.
 
let roll = 1;
do {
  console.log("Roll: " + roll);
  roll++;
} while (roll <= 6);

For loops are used when you know the exact number of iterations while, while and do while loops are used when the number of iterations is condition dependent. For loops have an explicit initialization step within the loop header, while while and do while loops require you to initialize the loop control variable before the loop. Do while loops guarantee that their body is executed at least once, while for and while loops may not execute the body at all if the initial condition is false.

In JavaScript, functions can be categorized into two main types based on their parameters, inputs, non-parameterized functions and parameterized functions.

Non-parameterized functions do not require any parameters to operate. They can perform their tasks without receiving any specific input values. Non-parameterized functions are often used for tasks that rely solely on their internal logic or external factors. Parameterized functions except one or more parameters, also called arguments that provide input data for the function to work with. You define these parameters in the function's declaration, and when you call the function, you pass specific values for those parameters.

Parameters are variables you define in the function declaration to accept input values. Arguments are the actual values you pass to a function when calling it.

There are two ways of writing a function in JavaScript, function declaration, function expression.

Function declaration is the traditional way to define a function. We start by declaring it using the keyword function, then we write the function name and the parameters.

Function expression is another way to define a function in JavaScript. Here we define a function using a variable and store the returned value in that variable.

Types of functions in JavaScript: named function, immediately invoked function expression, IIFE, arrow function and anonymous function.

Named functions have specific names that can be called by their names. They are typically declared using the function keyword and can be defined at any point in your code. Named function expressions are beneficial for debugging because they display the function's name in the call stack, aiding and identifying and tracking bugs in your code.

Immediately invoked function expression, or IIFE, is a function in JavaScript that's defined and executed immediately after its creation. It's often employed to encapsulate variables and code within a private scope, helping to prevent global scope contamination and variable conflicts. 

The arrow function is a more concise way to write functions introduced in ES6. They are often used for short, simple functions. 

Anonymous functions are without a name. These are often used as arguments for other functions or assigned to variables. For example, you can create anonymous functions using the arrow function syntax.

Arrow functions are especially useful for simple one liner functions. Here's an overview of arrow functions. Arrow functions have a more compact and readable syntax. They use a fat arrow to define the function, which is why they're commonly referred to as arrow functions. Arrow functions do not require the function keyword.

const multi = (a, b) => a * b;

Arrow functions can be categorized in two ways, parameterized and non parameterized functions.

const greet = () => {
    return `Hello, World!`;
}

The return statement is used to produce an output value from a function. This output can be a specific data value, a calculated result, or even another function. It serves as an exit point for a function. Once a return statement is encountered, the function terminates and the control flow is handed back to the code that called the function. Return enables functions that can be used in various contexts because they provide results that can be captured and used by other parts of your code.

document.getElementById ('length'): This part of the code retrieves an HTML element by its ID, specifically searching for an element with the ID 'length'.

.value: After accessing the HTML element, .value is used to retrieve the value entered into the input field associated with that element. For instance, if a user enters '5' into the input field for length, .value retrieves the string '5'.

parseFloat(…): The parseFloat() function converts the string value retrieved from the input field to a floating-point number. This conversion ensures that the input, typically text entered by the user, is treated as a number and can be used in mathematical operations.

.innerText = `The area of the rectangle is: ${area}`;: Once the element is accessed, .innerText is used to modify the text content within that HTML element.

The backticks and ${} notation allow for the inclusion of JavaScript variables within a string (using template literals).

In Javascript, a function closure is a function that retains access to variables from its enclosing function scope. Even after the enclosing function has finished executing, closures allow you to create private variables, implement data hiding, and maintain state between function calls.

Example closure function- In this example, inner function is a closure because it can access the outer var variable from its containing function, outer function, even after outer function has finished executing.

function outerFunction() {
  const outerVar = "I am outside!";
  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVar); // innerFunction has access to outerVar
  }
  return innerFunction;
}

const closure = outerFunction();
closure(); // This will log "I am outside!"

Benefits- 
  1) Data Encapsulation: Closures allow you to encapsulate data within a function scope. Creating a private environment for variables. This is crucial for building modular and maintainable code. As it helps prevent unintended interference or modification of variables from outside the function.

  2) Information Hiding: By using closures, you can hide certain data and expose only the necessary parts of your code's functionality.

Closures enable functions to remember and maintain state between function calls. This is valuable for tasks like implementing counters, timers, or managing application state in event driven programming.

Function hoisting, is a behavior in Javascript where function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, allowing you to use a function before it's actually declared in the code. This behavior only applies to function declarations, not function expressions.

Example: 
sayHello();
// This works even though the function is called before it is defined

function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello");
}

greet(); // This will result in an error because greet is an expression and it is not hoisted

const greet = function () {
  console.log("Hello there");
};

Benefits:
Function hoisting can make code more readable and self explanatory, by allowing you to use functions before they are defined in the code. This can improve the logical flow of your code, and make it easier to understand. Hoisted functions can be defined at any point within their containing scope, regardless of the order in which they are called. This flexibility can be helpful when structuring your code and organizing related functions. Function hoisting is crucial for recursive functions, as it allows the function to call itself within its own definition. You can conditionally execute functions based on certain criteria without having to define them in a specific order.
